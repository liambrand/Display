## Introduction

This is a simple multi-threaded program, based on mbed OS5 for the FRDM-K64F.
It illustrates the use of a basic CAN library in loopback mode, using
interrupts. The name `Display` is related to the use of the program as the
starting point for an exercise in simulating a Driver Information subsystem.
